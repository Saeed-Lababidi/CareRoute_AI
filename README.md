# CareRoute AI  
**Ask once. Reach the right care.**

CareRoute AI is a Generative AI-powered conversational assistant that intelligently routes patients to the correct medical specialty *before* booking—reducing mis-bookings, wait times, wasted hospital capacity, and delayed care.

## 🧠 Problem

In Saudi Arabia, patients often self-book appointments without medical guidance, leading to:

- Wrong specialty bookings  
- Lost hospital revenue  
- Wasted time slots  
- Longer wait times  
- Delayed or missed care  

Estimates suggest that **30–40% of outpatient appointments** are booked with the wrong specialty, creating inefficiencies for patients, doctors, and hospitals :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Who Is Affected?

**Patients**
- Delayed care  
- Confusion  
- Stress  

**Doctors**
- Burnout  
- Wasted consultation time  

**Hospitals & Insurers**
- Resource inefficiency  
- Higher operational costs  

### Why Existing Solutions Fail

- Booking systems assume patients know which doctor they need  
- Symptom checkers diagnose but don’t integrate with scheduling  
- Call centers are expensive and don’t scale  

There is **no intelligent pre-appointment routing layer** in today’s systems :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
